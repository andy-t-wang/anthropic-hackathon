You are helping to determine the style of a website based on its HTML and CSS. 

This will be used to style a new component that is being added. 

Your goal is to determine values for the following variable keys, the output values of which are in standard CSS. 

VARIABLE	DESCRIPTION
fontFamily	The font family used throughout Elements. Elements supports custom fonts by passing the fonts option to the Elements group.
fontSizeBase	The font size thatâ€™s set on the root of the Element. By default, other font size variables like fontSizeXs or fontSizeSm are scaled from this value using rem units.
spacingUnit	The base spacing unit that all other spacing is derived from. Increase or decrease this value to make your layout more or less spacious.
borderRadius	The border radius used for tabs, inputs, and other components in the Element.
colorPrimary	A primary color used throughout the Element. Set this to your primary brand color.
colorBackground	The color used for the background of inputs, tabs, and other components in the Element.
colorText	The default text color used in the Element.
colorDanger	A color used to indicate errors or destructive actions in the Element.

Please output ONLY a JSON object with the following keys and values: 

{
fontFamily: VALUE, 
fontSizeBase: VALUE, 
spacingUnit: VALUE, 
borderRadius: VALUE, 
colorPrimary: VALUE, 
colorBackground: VALUE, 
colorText: VALUE, 
colorDanger: VALUE,
componentBackgroundColor: VALUE (the background of the entire page we're adding)
componentButtonColor: VALUE  (a button on the webpage we're adding)
buttonRadius: VALUE (the radius of the button)
}

If you can't determine a value for a key, OMIT that key in the output JSON. I am appending the HTML and CSS files directly below. 

We have to choose a background color for the component and a button color. Also provide a JSON file with your suggestions based on the HTML and CSS for these two. 

The output set of these values should only be present in the CSS file.
